## Prerequisites

- Strong understanding of basic machine learning concepts
- Python programming experience (intermediate level)
- Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
- Basic understanding of statistics and linear algebra

## Key Features

- **Hands-on**: Every module includes working code examples
- **Comprehensive**: Covers theory, implementation, and practical applications
- **Self-contained**: Each module can be run independently
- **Production-ready**: Focuses on real-world applications
- **Best practices**: Industry-standard approaches throughout

## Module Execution Time

Each module takes approximately 30-60 minutes to run through all demonstrations:
- Quick overview: 10-15 minutes
- Full walkthrough: 30-45 minutes
- With exercises: 60-90 minutes

## Tips for Success

1. **Follow the order**: Modules build on previous knowledge
2. **Run the code**: Don't just read - execute and experiment
3. **Modify examples**: Try different parameters and datasets
4. **Read comments**: Code is well-documented with explanations
5. **Take notes**: Each module ends with key takeaways

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module not found errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Memory errors**: Some modules use large datasets
   - Reduce sample sizes in examples
   - Close other applications

3. **Slow execution**: Tree-based models can be slow
   - Reduce n_estimators
   - Use fewer iterations
