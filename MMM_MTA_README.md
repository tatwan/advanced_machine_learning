# Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) & Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) Hands-On Lab

## Overview

This comprehensive Jupyter notebook provides a hands-on learning experience for understanding and implementing Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) and Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) - two essential techniques for measuring marketing effectiveness.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Marketing Measurement Challenges
- Understanding multi-channel complexity
- Time lag effects (Adstock)
- Diminishing returns and saturation
- External factors affecting marketing performance

### 2. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)
- **What it is**: Top-down aggregate approach to measure media effectiveness
- **Core concepts**: Adstock transformation, saturation curves, base vs. incremental sales
- **Implementation**: Building MMM models with Ridge regression
- **Applications**: Budget allocation, channel ROI analysis, long-term planning
- **When to use**: Offline presence, strategic planning, privacy-first environments

### 3. Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)
- **What it is**: Bottom-up customer journey analysis
- **Attribution models implemented**:
  - Last-Touch Attribution
  - First-Touch Attribution
  - Linear Attribution
  - Time-Decay Attribution
  - Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution
- **Applications**: Digital optimization, customer journey analysis, real-time decisions
- **When to use**: Digital-first businesses, short sales cycles, granular optimization

### 4. Comparing MMM vs MTA
- Side-by-side comparison of approaches
- When to use each method
- How to combine both for comprehensive insights
- Decision trees for selecting the right approach

### 5. Practical Considerations
- Common challenges and solutions
- Data quality requirements
- Model validation techniques
- Best practices for implementation
- Incrementality testing

### 6. Hands-On Exercises
- Budget optimization using MMM insights
- Comparing different attribution models
- Channel ROI calculation
- Real-world inspired datasets

## Dataset Information

The notebook uses **simulated real-world inspired datasets**:

### MMM Dataset
- **Type**: Retail/E-commerce marketing data
- **Time Period**: 2 years (104 weeks)
- **Channels**: TV, Digital, Radio, Print, Social Media
- **Metrics**: Weekly spend and sales
- **Realism**: Includes seasonality, holiday spikes, growth trends

### MTA Dataset
- **Type**: Customer journey clickstream data
- **Size**: 1,000 customer journeys
- **Touchpoints**: Social Media Ad, Search Ad, Display Ad, Email, Organic Search, Direct, Referral, Video Ad
- **Metrics**: Journey length, conversion value, touchpoint sequence
- **Realism**: Varying journey lengths (1-8 touchpoints), realistic first/last-touch distributions

### Why Simulated Data?

While we use simulated data in this notebook, it's designed to reflect real-world patterns:
- **Privacy**: No real customer data needed
- **Reproducibility**: Same results every time (random seed set)
- **Educational**: Clear cause-and-effect relationships for learning
- **Realistic**: Based on actual retail and e-commerce patterns

For production use, you would replace this with:
- Your actual marketing spend data (for MMM)
- Your clickstream/journey data (for MTA)

## Customization

### Using Your Own Data

#### For MMM:
Replace the data generation cell with:

```python
# Load your marketing data
mmm_data = pd.read_csv('your_marketing_data.csv')

# Required columns:
# - date (weekly/monthly timestamps)
# - channel_1_spend, channel_2_spend, ... (marketing spend by channel)
# - sales (or revenue, conversions, etc.)
```

#### For MTA:
Replace the journey generation cell with:

```python
# Load your customer journey data
journeys_df = pd.read_csv('your_journey_data.csv')

# Required columns:
# - customer_id
# - journey (list of touchpoints)
# - conversion_value
```

### Adjusting Parameters

Key parameters you can modify:

**MMM Model:**
- `adstock_decay`: Carryover effect (0-1). Higher = longer lasting impact
- `saturation_alpha`: Saturation scale parameter
- `saturation_gamma`: Saturation shape parameter. Lower = earlier saturation

**MTA Model:**
- `decay_rate`: How quickly credit decays for older touchpoints
- `first_last_weight`: Weight for first/last touch in position-based model
- Attribution window: Customize based on your sales cycle

## Validation and Testing

The notebook includes:
- Model diagnostics (residual analysis, Q-Q plots)
- Statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Durbin-Watson)
- Train/test split validation
- Performance metrics (RÂ², MAPE)

For production use, add:
- Incrementality tests (geo experiments, holdout tests)
- A/B tests for validation
- Regular model updates and monitoring

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Model overfits training data
**Solution**: Increase Ridge regularization parameter (alpha), use cross-validation, add more data

### Issue: Negative ROI for some channels
**Solution**: Check data quality, review transformations, consider interaction effects

### Issue: Residuals show patterns
**Solution**: Add more features (seasonality, events), try different transformations, check for missing variables

### Issue: Attribution models give very different results
**Solution**: This is normal - use multiple models, validate with incrementality tests, segment analysis
