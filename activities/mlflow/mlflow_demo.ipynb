    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Track experiments** - Log parameters, metrics, and models systematically\n",
    "2. ✅ **Use autologging** - Automatically capture ML metadata with minimal code\n",
    "3. ✅ **Manage models** - Version control and lifecycle management via Model Registry\n",
    "4. ✅ **Compare runs** - Evaluate different hyperparameter configurations side-by-side\n",
    "5. ✅ **Log artifacts** - Save plots, data files, and other outputs\n",
    "6. ✅ **Load models** - Retrieve and use previously trained models\n",
    "7. ✅ **Query experiments** - Programmatically search and filter runs\n",
    "8. ✅ **Serve models** - Deploy models for predictions (advanced)\n",

    "\n",
    "MLflow solves common ML challenges:\n",
    "- 📊 **Experiment tracking**: \"Which hyperparameters gave the best results?\"\n",

    "- 📦 **Model versioning**: \"Which model is currently in production?\"\n",
    "- 🤝 **Team collaboration**: Share experiments and models with teammates\n",
    "- 🚀 **Deployment**: Package and deploy models consistently\n",

    "## Understanding MLflow Core Concepts\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔬 **Experiment**\n",
    "A logical grouping of related runs. Think of it as a project or research question (e.g., \"Customer Churn Prediction\" or \"Image Classification v2\"). All runs related to solving the same problem go into one experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏃 **Run**\n",
    "A single execution of your model training code. Each time you train a model (even with different parameters), that's a new run. A run contains:\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Input values that don't change during training (e.g., `learning_rate=0.01`, `n_estimators=100`)\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Output values that measure performance (e.g., `accuracy=0.95`, `loss=0.23`)\n",
    "- **Artifacts**: Files produced during the run (models, plots, data files, etc.)\n",
    "- **Metadata**: Start time, end time, source code version, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Parameters vs Metrics**\n",
    "- **Parameters** are inputs you SET (hyperparameters, configurations)\n",
    "- **Metrics** are outputs you MEASURE (accuracy, precision, loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 **Artifacts**\n",
    "Any file you want to save: trained models, plots, preprocessors, feature importance charts, confusion matrices, etc.\n",

    "## 8. MLflow Best Practices & Tips 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "### **For Students & Practitioners:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📝 Use Descriptive Run Names**\n",
    "   - Bad: `run1`, `run2`, `test`\n",
    "   - Good: `lr_baseline`, `rf_tuned_v2`, `final_production_model`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🏷️ Tag Everything**\n",
    "   - Use tags to categorize runs: `model_family`, `dataset_version`, `experiment_type`\n",
    "   - Makes searching and filtering much easier later\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **📊 Log What Matters**\n",
    "   - Parameters: All hyperparameters that affect the model\n",
    "   - Metrics: Not just accuracy - log precision, recall, F1, training time, etc.\n",
    "   - Artifacts: Confusion matrices, feature importance plots, preprocessors\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🔄 Use Autologging When Possible**\n",
    "   - Saves time and ensures consistency\n",
    "   - Works great for scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **🎯 Model Registry Workflow**\n",
    "   - Development → None stage\n",
    "   - Testing complete → Staging stage\n",
    "   - Production ready → Production stage\n",
    "   - Deprecated → Archived stage\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **🔍 Search & Compare Frequently**\n",
    "   - Use the UI to compare runs visually\n",
    "   - Use `mlflow.search_runs()` for programmatic analysis\n",
    "   - Filter by metrics to find best models quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **📦 Log Complete Artifacts**\n",
    "   - Don't just log the model - log the preprocessor, encoder, scaler, etc.\n",
    "   - Future you will thank present you!\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **🚫 Use a .gitignore File**\n",
    "   - Your `mlruns/` folder can become very large with experiment data\n",
    "   - **Don't commit it to Git!** Add `mlruns/` to your `.gitignore` file\n",
    "   - This keeps your repository clean and avoids uploading large model files\n",
    "   - Example `.gitignore` entry:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     mlruns/\n",
    "     *.pyc\n",
    "     __pycache__/\n",

    "**Solution:** Use `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead of `http://localhost:5000`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 3: \"Cannot load model - Run not found\"\n",
    "**Solution:** Check that the run_id is correct. Use `mlflow.search_runs()` to find valid run IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 4: \"Model Registry errors\"\n",
    "**Solution:** Make sure you've registered the model first with `mlflow.register_model()` before trying to transition stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 5: \"Autologging not working\"\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "- Call `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` BEFORE training\n",
    "- Make sure you're inside a `with mlflow.start_run():` block\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! 🎉 You've learned the essential features of MLflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Experiment Tracking** - Log parameters, metrics, and models  \n",
    "✅ **Autologging** - Automatic logging for popular frameworks  \n",
    "✅ **Model Registry** - Version control and lifecycle management  \n",
    "✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Compare multiple runs systematically  \n",
    "✅ **Artifact Logging** - Save plots, data, and files  \n",
    "✅ **Model Loading** - Load and use saved models  \n",
    "✅ **Querying** - Search and filter runs programmatically  \n",
    "✅ **Model Serving** - Deploy models as APIs  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** MLflow is a tool to help you be more organized and productive in ML projects. Start simple, use autologging, and gradually incorporate more features as needed.\n",
