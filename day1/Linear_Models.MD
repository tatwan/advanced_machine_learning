# Linear Models: Optimization and Evaluation - Notebook Guide

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook (`linear_models_optimization_evaluation.ipynb`) is a comprehensive hands-on lab that demonstrates advanced machine learning concepts for optimizing and evaluating linear models.

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Optimizing and Training Linear Models

1. **Understanding Gradient Descent Optimization**
   - How gradient descent works and its variants (SGD, mini-batch, batch)
   - Comparing different learning rate schedules
   - Practical implementation with SGDClassifier

2. **L1 and L2/ElasticNet Regularization**
   - Understanding regularization to prevent overfitting
   - L1 (Lasso) for feature selection
   - L2 (Ridge) for coefficient shrinkage
   - ElasticNet combining both approaches
   - Visualizing coefficient magnitudes

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Linear and non-linear classification
   - Kernel methods (linear, RBF, polynomial, sigmoid)
   - Understanding the kernel trick
   - Hyperparameter effects (C, gamma)

4. **k-Folds Cross Validation**
   - Robust model evaluation technique
   - Comparing different k values
   - Model comparison using cross-validation

### Part 2: Evaluating Models

5. **Metrics for Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix interpretation
   - Classification reports
   - When to use which metric

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Grid Search for systematic parameter exploration
   - Finding optimal regularization strength
   - Visualizing hyperparameter impact

7. **Threshold Tuning**
   - Adjusting decision thresholds beyond 0.5
   - Precision-Recall trade-offs
   - Tuning for business requirements

8. **Handling Class Imbalance**
   - Class weights
   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
   - Random undersampling
   - Comparing strategies

9. **Advanced Metrics**
   - ROC curves and ROC-AUC
   - Precision-Recall curves
   - Average Precision scores
   - When to use PR curves vs ROC curves

## Dataset

The notebook uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin** dataset, a real-world medical dataset included in scikit-learn:

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Samples**: 569 cases
- **Features**: 30 numerical features computed from digitized images
- **Target**: Binary classification (Malignant vs Benign)
- **Use Case**: Medical diagnosis - perfect for demonstrating evaluation metrics and threshold tuning

### Why This Dataset?

1. **Real-world relevance**: Medical diagnosis applications
2. **Public availability**: Included in scikit-learn, no download needed
3. **Class balance**: Slightly imbalanced (~63% benign, 37% malignant)
4. **Good size**: Large enough to demonstrate concepts, small enough to run quickly
5. **Multiple features**: Suitable for demonstrating regularization and feature selection

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn jupyter
```

### Knowledge Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Python and NumPy
- Basic knowledge of classification problems
- Understanding of train-test split concept

## How to Use This Notebook

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tatwan/advanced_machine_learning.git
cd advanced_machine_learning

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook linear_models_optimization_evaluation.ipynb

# Or use JupyterLab
jupyter lab linear_models_optimization_evaluation.ipynb
```

### 3. Running the Notebook

- **Run all cells sequentially**: The notebook is designed to be run from top to bottom
- **Interactive exploration**: Each section is self-contained; you can modify parameters and re-run cells
- **Visualizations**: Multiple plots demonstrate concepts visually
- **Experimentation**: Try changing hyperparameters to see their effects

## Key Highlights

### Comprehensive Coverage

- âœ… 37 total cells (13 markdown + 24 code)
- âœ… Detailed markdown explanations for each concept
- âœ… Real dataset from scikit-learn (no random data)
- âœ… Extensive visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, ROC/PR curves)
- âœ… Comparative analyses (different algorithms, parameters, strategies)

### Practical Examples

1. **Gradient Descent**: Compare 4 different learning rate schedules
2. **Regularization**: Visualize how L1 produces sparse models vs L2
3. **SVM Kernels**: Compare performance of 4 kernel types
4. **Cross-Validation**: Test models with 3, 5, and 10 folds
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search over 12 parameter combinations
6. **Threshold Analysis**: Test 6 different classification thresholds
7. **Imbalance Handling**: Compare 4 strategies (no handling, weights, SMOTE, undersampling)
8. **Advanced Metrics**: Generate ROC and PR curves with AUC scores

## Tips for Learning

1. **Read the markdown cells carefully**: They explain the theory before the code
2. **Modify parameters**: Change values and see how results change
3. **Add your own cells**: Try additional experiments
4. **Print intermediate results**: Add print statements to understand data shapes
5. **Visualize more**: Create additional plots to explore the data

## Common Use Cases

### For Students
- Learn ML optimization techniques
- Understand evaluation metrics
- Practice with real datasets
- Prepare for ML interviews

### For Practitioners
- Quick reference for hyperparameter tuning
- Templates for handling imbalanced data
- Best practices for model evaluation
- Comparison of different approaches

### For Researchers

## Extending the Notebook

Feel free to extend this notebook by:

1. **Adding more datasets**: Try with diabetes, iris, or custom datasets
2. **More algorithms**: Add decision trees, random forests, neural networks
3. **Advanced techniques**: Implement custom metrics, ensemble methods
4. **Deep dives**: Focus on one topic with more detail
5. **Performance optimization**: Add timing comparisons, memory profiling

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you get import errors, ensure all packages are installed:
```bash
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Kernel Crashes
If the kernel crashes:
- Restart the kernel and run all cells
- Check memory usage (especially with large datasets)

### Visualization Issues
If plots don't show:
```python
%matplotlib inline  # Add this at the top
```
